# File: contact.tsx

## What This File Does
`contact.tsx` is the **Contact page**. It exports a `ContactPage` component that renders a two-column layout (contact info on the left, a working contact form on the right) plus a Google Maps embed below. The form posts to a Formspree endpoint (placeholder for now), supports four submit states (idle/sending/success/error), includes a hidden honeypot anti-spam field, and can preselect a service in its dropdown via a `?service=...` URL query string (used by the pricing page's deep-link CTAs).

## Where It Lives in the Project
- **Path:** `src/components/pages/contact.tsx`
- **Route:** `contact` → URL `#/contact` (also accepts `#/contact?service=<encoded>` for deep-linking)
- Imported by `src/app/page.tsx`; rendered by `RouterOutlet` when `route === "contact"`.

## What It Produces
The visitor sees, top to bottom:
1. **PageHero** — small-height dark image banner with eyebrow, H1, and lead.
2. **Info + form section** — two columns (info:form = 2:3 on large screens):
   - **Left (info):** an H2 heading, a short paragraph, and 5 contact info rows (address, phone, WhatsApp, email, hours). Each row has a teal icon tile, a small uppercase label, and the value (clickable where appropriate: tel:, https://wa.me/, mailto:).
   - **Right (form):** a card containing the contact form — first name, last name, email, phone, service dropdown, message, honeypot (hidden), submit button, optional error banner, and a privacy notice linking to `/privacy`.
3. **Map section** — a card with a header row (map title + "Open in Google Maps" button) and a 420px-tall Google Maps iframe embed.

## Key Concepts

- **`useLang()`** — returns `{ lang, setLang, t }`. Both `t` and `lang` are used.
- **`pageContent[lang].pages.contact`** (aliased `p`) — page-level copy (hero, `mapTitle`, `mapBody`).
- **`companyFacts`** — a single-source-of-truth object from `@/lib/site-data` holding phone, email, address, WhatsApp URL, etc. Used here so the contact info never drifts out of sync with the footer or other pages.
- **`useState` with a union type** — `status` is typed as `"idle" | "sending" | "success" | "error"`. TypeScript enforces that only those four strings can be passed to `setStatus`, preventing typos.
- **Lazy state initialization** — `useState(() => {...})` takes a function that runs only on the first render. Used here to parse the URL query string once (avoiding re-parsing on every render).
- **SSR guard** — `if (typeof window === "undefined") return undefined;` because Next.js renders components on the server first, where `window` doesn't exist. Without this guard, the page would crash during server-side rendering.
- **Honeypot anti-spam field** — a hidden form input named `_gotcha`. Humans never see it (CSS `hidden` + `aria-hidden` + `tabIndex={-1}`), so they leave it blank. Bots that auto-fill all form fields will populate it. On submit, the handler checks if `_gotcha` has a value; if so, it pretends success and silently aborts (never sends the data). This is a lightweight, no-CAPTCHA spam filter.
- **`FormData`** — a built-in browser API for reading all named form fields at once. `new FormData(form)` collects every input's value, which `fetch` can POST directly as a multipart body (no manual JSON serialization needed).
- **`async/await` + `try/catch`** — the `onSubmit` handler is async because it `await`s the fetch. The `try/catch` distinguishes HTTP errors (non-2xx response) from network errors (fetch threw).
- **Formspree** — a third-party form backend that accepts POSTs to `https://formspree.io/f/<form-id>` and emails the submissions. The endpoint here is a placeholder (`your-form-id`) that must be replaced before launch.
- **Service preselect from URL** — the `preselectedService` state initializer parses `window.location.hash` for a `?service=...` query string. The `Select` component's `defaultValue={preselectedService}` makes the dropdown start on that option. The pricing page builds these deep-link URLs.
- **`Select` (shadcn/ui)** — a styled wrapper around Radix UI's Select primitive. `defaultValue` sets the initial selection; `SelectTrigger`/`SelectValue`/`SelectContent`/`SelectItem` compose the dropdown.
- **`Button` disabled state** — `disabled={status === "sending" || status === "success"}` prevents double-submits while a request is in flight and locks the button after success.
- **Google Maps embed** — an `<iframe>` with `src="https://www.google.com/maps?q=...&output=embed"`. This is Google's free embed endpoint that requires no API key. `loading="lazy"` defers loading until the iframe is near the viewport.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### Imports & `ContactPage` component
- Block components (`PageHero`), `Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select` parts, `useState`, Lucide icons, `companyFacts`, `RouterLink`.
- Reads `{ t, lang }`, `p`, and sets up `status` + `preselectedService` state.

### `onSubmit` async function
- Prevents default, builds `FormData`, checks honeypot, sets status to "sending", POSTs to Formspree, transitions to success/error. See the JSDoc comment in the file for the full flow.

### `infoItems` array
- An array of 5 contact-info objects, each with `{ icon, label, value, href? }`. Built before the JSX so the render is just a `.map`.

### PageHero
- Small height (`height="sm"`).

### Info + form section (white)
- 5-column grid (`lg:grid-cols-5`): info = 2 cols, form = 3 cols.
- **Info column** — H2 (`t.contact.info.addressLabel`), paragraph (`p.mapBody`), then `.map` over `infoItems`. Each row: icon tile + label + value. If `item.href` exists, the value is wrapped in an `<a>` (with `target="_blank"` for http URLs).
- **Form column** — a `<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>` containing:
  - First/last name row (2 cols).
  - Email/phone row (2 cols).
  - Service `<Select>` with `defaultValue={preselectedService}`.
  - Message `<Textarea>`.
  - **Honeypot** — hidden `_gotcha` input.
  - **Submit `<Button>`** — disabled while sending/success. Renders different icon + label per `status`:
    - `sending` — spinner + "Sending..."
    - `success` — check icon + "Sent!"
    - `error` — alert icon + the normal submit label (so the user can retry)
    - `idle` — send icon + the normal submit label
  - **Error banner** (only when `status === "error"`) — a rose-tinted box with the error message and a `mailto:` link fallback.
  - **Privacy notice** — small text linking to `/privacy`.

### Map section (slate-50 background)
- A bordered card with a header row: left side has `p.mapTitle` + the address; right side has an "Open in Google Maps" outline button (links to `google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...`).
- Below: a `relative h-[420px]` container holding an absolutely-positioned `<iframe>` with the Google Maps embed URL.

  - `@/lib/site-data` → `companyFacts`
  - `@/lib/router` → `RouterLink`
- **Imported by:** `src/app/page.tsx`.
- **Router mapping:** URL `#/contact` (or `#/contact?service=...`) → route `"contact"`.
- **Deep-link integration:** receives `?service=<encoded>` URLs from `src/components/pages/pricing.tsx` (the tier CTA buttons).

## Common Beginner Questions

**Q: What is a honeypot field, and why use it instead of reCAPTCHA?**
A: A honeypot is a hidden form field that humans can't see but bots auto-fill. On submit, if it has a value, you know it's a bot and silently drop the submission. Honeypots are invisible to real users (no "I'm not a robot" checkbox), require no third-party script, and have no privacy concerns. The trade-off: sophisticated bots can learn to skip hidden fields, so it's less robust than reCAPTCHA — but it's a great lightweight first line of defense.

**Q: Why does the form status auto-revert to "idle" after a few seconds?**
A: So the success message disappears and the form becomes usable again (e.g., if the user wants to send a second message). The `setTimeout` calls reset `status` to `"idle"` after 5 seconds (success) or 4 seconds (honeypot fake-success). The error state does NOT auto-revert — it stays visible until the user retries.

**Q: How does the service preselect work end-to-end?**
A: On the pricing page, each tier's CTA button is `<a href="#/contact?service=Company%20Incorporation">`. When clicked, the URL changes (no full page reload). The contact page mounts, and its `preselectedService` state initializer reads `window.location.hash`, finds the `?service=` portion, URL-decodes the value, and returns it. The `<Select defaultValue={preselectedService}>` then starts with that option selected. The user sees the form with the right service already picked — a small but satisfying UX touch.
