/**
 * BASE TRANSLATION DICTIONARY (English / Traditional Chinese / Simplified Chinese)
 * =================================================================
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS:
 *   The BASE translation dictionary for the entire Smarthub Connect site.
 *   Holds the short UI strings for the navigation, hero, services,
 *   pricing, contact, footer, etc. in all 3 supported languages.
 *
 *   ⚠️ This file is the BASE only. The full runtime dictionary is built
 *   by `buildDict()` in `./lang-context.tsx`, which merges this file with
 *   `./page-content.ts` (long-form page text) and `./extra-content.ts`
 *   (cookie banner, legal, not-found, etc.). Components read the merged
 *   dictionary via `useLang().t` — they never import this file directly.
 *
 * STRUCTURE:
 *   `translations` is a plain object with 3 top-level keys — one per
 *   language: `en`, `"zh-HK"`, `"zh-CN"`. Each language has the SAME set
 *   of section keys (meta, nav, topbar, hero, about, services, whyhk,
 *   pricing, stats, insights, contact, footer). Each section holds the
 *   strings for one part of the UI.
 *
 *   `as const` at the end tells TypeScript to infer literal types
 *   (e.g. "Starter" instead of `string`), giving better autocomplete.
 *
 * TOP-LEVEL SECTION KEYS (what each controls):
 *   meta       — page <title> + meta description (used by some pages'
 *                Next.js metadata and as JSON-LD fallback)
 *   nav        — top navigation bar labels + CTA button text
 *   topbar     — slim utility strip above navbar (phone, WhatsApp, email,
 *                TCSP licence badge)
 *   hero       — homepage hero: eyebrow, title (split into title +
 *                titleAccent for styling), lead, 2 CTAs, 4 stat items
 *   about      — About page: eyebrow, title, body, body2, 4 bullet points
 *   services   — Services page: 4 service items (each with tag, title,
 *                desc, features list) + a CTA label
 *   whyhk      — "Why Hong Kong" page: eyebrow, title, lead, 6 cards
 *   pricing    — Pricing page: 3 tiers (Starter/Professional/Enterprise,
 *                each with name, price, features list, popular flag) +
 *                6 workspace add-ons + disclaimer
 *   stats      — mid-page stats band: section title + 6 stat items
 *   insights   — Insights/blog page: eyebrow, title, lead, 3 articles
 *   contact    — Contact page: form labels + service options + contact info
 *   footer     — site-wide footer: tagline, link labels, legal note,
 *                copyright
 *
 * HOW TO ADD A NEW STRING:
 *   1. Add it under the SAME section key in all 3 languages (en, zh-HK,
 *      zh-CN). TypeScript will error if you forget one.
 *   2. Use it in a component: `const { t } = useLang(); t.hero.title`
 *
 * HOW TO ADD A NEW LANGUAGE:
 *   1. Add the new code to the `Lang` union type below
 *   2. Add an entry to the `LANGS` array below
 *   3. Add a new top-level key (e.g. `ja: {...}`) to `translations`
 *      mirroring the structure of `en`
 *   4. Repeat for page-content.ts and extra-content.ts
 *   5. Update `detectInitialLang()` in lang-context.tsx to detect it
 * =================================================================

// `Lang` — union type listing the 3 language codes supported by the site.

export type Lang = "en" | "zh-HK" | "zh-CN";

// LANGS — array describing each language for the Language Switcher UI.
