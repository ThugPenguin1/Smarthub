/**
 * ROOT LAYOUT (Next.js App Router)
 * =================================================================
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS:
 *   The top-level shell that wraps EVERY page in the Next.js App Router.
 *   In Next.js 13+, any file named `layout.tsx` inside `app/` defines a
 *   layout that surrounds all pages in that folder and its subfolders.
 *   This `app/layout.tsx` is the *root* layout — it wraps everything.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES:
 *   - Imports two web fonts (Plus Jakarta Sans for headings, DM Sans for body)
 *   - Imports the global stylesheet (`globals.css`) so Tailwind loads
 *   - Declares SEO `metadata` (title, description, OpenGraph, Twitter cards,
 *     favicons, etc.) that Next.js turns into <meta> tags in the <head>
 *   - Embeds JSON-LD structured data so Google understands we are a
 *     LocalBusiness / FinancialService in Hong Kong
 *   - Wraps the page content in <LangProvider> (so the trilingual dictionary
 *     is available everywhere) and renders the toast notifications <Toaster>
 *
 * HOW IT FITS IN THE BIGGER PICTURE:
 *   `src/app/page.tsx` is the actual page content (the `children` prop here).
 *   Anything you put in this layout shows up on every route of the site —
 *   which is why it's the perfect place for fonts, SEO, and global providers.

/**
 * `metadata` is a Next.js convention. By exporting a `metadata` object from a
 * layout or page, Next.js automatically injects the right <meta> tags into the
 * HTML <head> at build time. This is great for SEO — search engines and social
 * media previews (Twitter cards, Facebook OpenGraph) read these tags.
 *
 * NOTE: companyFacts is imported from `src/lib/site-data.ts` so phone/email/
 * domain stay in ONE place. If the company moves or renames, you only update
 * site-data.ts and every meta tag updates too.
