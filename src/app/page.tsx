/**
 * MAIN PAGE — Home / App Entry
 * =================================================================
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS:
 *   The single page that Next.js renders at the URL `/`. Because this
 *   project uses a CUSTOM HASH ROUTER (see `src/lib/router.tsx`) instead
 *   of Next.js's built-in file-based routing, there is ONE page file and
 *   it swaps content inside based on the URL hash.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES:
 *   - Wraps the whole UI in `<RouterProvider>` so any nested component
 *     can read the current route via `useRouter()`
 *   - Renders the global chrome: Navbar (top), Footer (bottom), WhatsApp
 *     floating button, Back-to-Top button, and Cookie Consent banner
 *   - Renders a `<RouterOutlet>` — a switch statement that picks the
 *     right page component (Home/About/Services/etc.) based on the
 *     current route
 *   - Renders a skip link for keyboard / screen-reader users
 *
 * HOW IT FITS IN THE BIGGER PICTURE:
 *   This is the `children` passed into `RootLayout` (see layout.tsx).
 *   All actual page content lives in `src/components/pages/*.tsx`. This
 *   file is just the conductor: it picks which page component to show
 *   based on the hash router's state.
 *
 * WHY "use client"?
 *   The hash router depends on `window.location.hash`, which only exists
 *   in the browser. The "use client" directive tells Next.js to render
 *   this component on the client side (after hydration) so it can read
 *   the URL hash and respond to hashchange events.

 * RouterOutlet — the SWITCH that picks which page component to render.
 *
 * This is the heart of the custom routing system. `useRouter()` returns
 * the current `route` value (a union type like "home" | "about" | ...).
 * The switch statement maps each possible route to a page component.
 *
 * Why a switch instead of a routing table library?
 *   It's the simplest possible router. Each case is one route. The
 *   `LegalPage` component is reused for 4 different legal routes via a
 *   `which` prop ("privacy" | "terms" | "complaints" | "disclosures").
 *
 * Inputs: none (reads from `useRouter()` context)
 * Returns: JSX of the matching page component (or `<HomePage />` as a
 * fallback default).
